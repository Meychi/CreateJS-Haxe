/**
* <strong>Note: AudioSprite is not a class, but its usage is easily lost in the documentation, so it has been called
*	out here for quick reference.</strong>
*	
*	Audio sprites are much like CSS sprites or image sprite sheets: multiple audio assets grouped into a single file.
*	Audio sprites work around limitations in certain browsers, where only a single sound can be loaded and played at a
*	time. We recommend at least 300ms of silence between audio clips to deal with HTML audio tag inaccuracy, and to prevent
*	accidentally playing bits of the neighbouring clips.
*	
*	<strong>Benefits of Audio Sprites:</strong>
*	<ul>
*	    <li>More robust support for older browsers and devices that only allow a single audio instance, such as iOS 5.</li>
*	    <li>They provide a work around for the Internet Explorer 9 audio tag limit, which restricts how many different
*	    sounds that could be loaded at once.</li>
*	    <li>Faster loading by only requiring a single network request for several sounds, especially on mobile devices
*	where the network round trip for each file can add significant latency.</li>
*	</ul>
*	
*	<strong>Drawbacks of Audio Sprites</strong>
*	<ul>
*	    <li>No guarantee of smooth looping when using HTML or Flash audio. If you have a track that needs to loop
*			smoothly and you are supporting non-web audio browsers, do not use audio sprites for that sound if you can avoid
*			it.</li>
*	    <li>No guarantee that HTML audio will play back immediately, especially the first time. In some browsers
*	    (Chrome!), HTML audio will only load enough to play through at the current download speed â€“ so we rely on the
*	    `canplaythrough` event to determine if the audio is loaded. Since audio sprites must jump ahead to play specific
*	    sounds, the audio may not yet have downloaded fully.</li>
*	    <li>Audio sprites share the same core source, so if you have a sprite with 5 sounds and are limited to 2
*			concurrently playing instances, you can only play 2 of the sounds at the same time.</li>
*	</ul>
*	
*	<h4>Example</h4>
*	
*			createjs.Sound.initializeDefaultPlugins();
*			var assetsPath = "./assets/";
*			var sounds = [{
*				src:"MyAudioSprite.ogg", data: {
*					audioSprite: [
*						{id:"sound1", startTime:0, duration:500},
*						{id:"sound2", startTime:1000, duration:400},
*						{id:"sound3", startTime:1700, duration: 1000}
*					]}
*				}
*			];
*			createjs.Sound.alternateExtensions = ["mp3"];
*			createjs.Sound.on("fileload", loadSound);
*			createjs.Sound.registerSounds(sounds, assetsPath);
*			// after load is complete
*			createjs.Sound.play("sound2");
*	
*	You can also create audio sprites on the fly by setting the startTime and duration when creating an new AbstractSoundInstance.
*	
*			createjs.Sound.play("MyAudioSprite", {startTime: 1000, duration: 400});
*	
*	The excellent CreateJS community has created a tool to create audio sprites, available at
*	<a href="https://github.com/tonistiigi/audiosprite" target="_blank">https://github.com/tonistiigi/audiosprite</a>,
*	as well as a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/bharat_battu/g8fFP/12/" target="_blank">jsfiddle</a> to convert the output
*	to SoundJS format.
