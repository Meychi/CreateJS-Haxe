/**
* A PreloadJS plugin provides a way to inject functionality into PreloadJS to load file types that are unsupported,
*	or in a way that PreloadJS does not.
*	
*	<strong>Note that this class is mainly for documentation purposes, and is not a real plugin.</strong>
*	
*	Plugins are registered based on file extension, or supported preload types, which are defined as constants on
*	the {{#crossLink "LoadQueue"}}{{/crossLink}} class. Available load types are:
*	<ul>
*	    <li>binary ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/BINARY:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	    <li>css ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/CSS:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	    <li>image ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/IMAGE:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	    <li>javascript ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/JAVASCRIPT:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	    <li>json ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/JSON:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	    <li>jsonp ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/JSONP:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	    <li>manifest ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/MANIFEST:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	    <li>sound ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/SOUND:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	    <li>spriteSheet ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/SPRITESHEET:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	    <li>svg ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/SVG:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	    <li>text ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/TEXT:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	    <li>xml ({{#crossLink "LoadQueue/XML:property"}}{{/crossLink}})</li>
*	</ul>
*	
*	A plugin defines what types or extensions it handles via a {{#crossLink "SamplePlugin/getPreloadHandlers"}}{{/crossLink}}
*	method, which is called when a plugin is first registered.
*	
*	To register a plugin with PreloadJS, simply install it into a LoadQueue before files begin to load using the
*	{{#crossLink "LoadQueue/installPlugin"}}{{/crossLink}} method:
*	
*	     var queue = new createjs.LoadQueue();
*	     queue.installPlugin(createjs.SamplePlugin);
*	     queue.loadFile("test.jpg");
*	
*	The {{#crossLink "SamplePlugin/getPreloadHandlers"}}{{/crossLink}} method can also return a `callback`
*	property, which is a function that will be invoked before each file is loaded. Check out the {{#crossLink "SamplePlugin/preloadHandler"}}{{/crossLink}}
*	for more information on how the callback works. For example, the SoundJS plugin allows PreloadJS to manage a
*	download that uses the Flash Player.

	/**
	* This is a sample method to show how to handle the callback specified in the {{#crossLink "LoadQueue/getPreloadHandlers"}}{{/crossLink}}.
	*	Right before a file is loaded, if a plugin for the file type or extension is found, then the callback for that
	*	plugin will be invoked. This gives the plugin an opportunity to modify the load item, or even cancel the load.
	*	The return value of the callback determines how PreloadJS will handle the file:
	*	<ul>
	*	    <li><strong>false:</strong> Skip the item. This allows plugins to determine if a file should be loaded or
	*	    not. For example,the plugin could determine if a file type is supported at all on the current system, and
	*	    skip those that do not.</li>
	*	    <li><strong>true:</strong> Continue normally. The plugin will not affect the load.</li>
	*	    <li><strong>AbstractLoader instance:</strong> Used as the loader for the content. This is new in 0.6.0.</li>
	*	</ul>
	*	
	*	Since the {{#crossLink "LoadItem"}}{{/crossLink}} is passed by reference, a plugin can modify as needed, even
	*	appending additional data to it. Note that if the {{#crossLink "LoadItem/src:property"}}{{/crossLink}} is
	*	modified, PreloadJS will automatically update the {{#crossLink "LoadItem/ext:property"}}{{/crossLink}} property.
	*	
	*	<h4>Example</h4>
	*	
	*	     // Cancel a load
	*	     SamplePlugin.preloadHandler = function(loadItem, queue) {
	*	         if (loadItem.id.indexOf("thumb") { return false; } // Don't load items like "image-thumb.png"
	*	         return true;
	*	     }
	*	
	*	     // Specify a completeHandler
	*	     SamplePlugin.preloadHandler = function(loadItem, queue) {
	*	         item.completeHandler = SamplePlugin.fileLoadHandler;
	*	     }
	*	
	*	     // Check out the SamplePlugin source to see another example.
	*	
	*	<em>Note: In 0.4.2 and earlier, instead of a {{#crossLink "LoadItem"}}{{/crossLink}}, arguments were passed in,
	*	and a modified object was returned to PreloadJS. This has been changed to passing a reference to the LoadItem,
	*	which can be directly modified.</em>
	* @param loadItem The item that PreloadJS is going to load. This item is passes by reference,
	*	so it can be directly modified.
	* @param queue The {{#crossLink "LoadQueue"}}{{/crossLink}} instance that is preloading the item.

	/**
	* When a plugin is installed, this method will be called to let PreloadJS know when to invoke the plugin.
	*	
	*	PreloadJS expects this method to return an object containing:
	*	<ul>
	*	    <li><strong>callback:</strong> The function to call on the plugin class right before an item is loaded. Check
	*	    out the {{#crossLink "SamplePlugin/preloadHandler"}}{{/crossLink}} method for more information. The callback
	*	    is automatically called in the scope of the plugin.</li>
	*	    <li><strong>types:</strong> An array of recognized PreloadJS load types to handle. Supported load types are
	*	    "binary","image", "javascript", "json", "jsonp", "sound", "svg", "text", and "xml".</li>
	*	    <li><strong>extensions:</strong> An array of strings containing file extensions to handle, such as "jpg",
	*	    "mp3", etc. This only fires if an applicable type handler is not found by the plugin.</li>
	*	</ul>
	*	
	*	Note that currently, PreloadJS only supports a single handler for each extension or file type.

	*	     }
	*	
	*	If a plugin provides both "type" and "extension" handlers, the type handler will take priority, and will only
	*	fire once per file. For example if you have a handler for type=sound, and for extension=mp3, the callback will
	*	fire when it matches the type.
